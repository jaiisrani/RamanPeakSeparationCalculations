# RamanPeakSeparationCalculations

The Raman spectra for a single point in a two dimensional thin film of molybdenum sulphide contains two main peaks. To find out the number of layers contained in the film, it is imperative to calculate the wavenumber separtions between both peaks.

The Python script Raman_peak_finding.py can be used to read the data from Raman spectroscopy and plot a spatial profile of the peak separation described above.
